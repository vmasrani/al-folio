I'm a Ph.D student working in machine learning and probabilistic programming at the University of British Columbia. I am a member of the [PLAI lab](https://plai.cs.ubc.ca/) under the supervision of [Frank Wood](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood/index.html).

Before this I was supervised by [Giuseppe Carenini](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~carenini/) in the [Laboratory for Computational Intelligence](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/cs-research/lci) where I completed my M.Sc. in artificial intelligence. I have also had the good fortune of working with [Siamak Ravanbakhsh](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~siamakx/), [Emtiyaz Khan](https://emtiyaz.github.io), and [Colin Gay](https://www.phas.ubc.ca/users/colin-gay) in deep learning, approximate bayesian inference, and particle physics, respectively.

My CV is [here]({{ "assets/pdf/masrani_resume.pdf" | absolute_url }}).
