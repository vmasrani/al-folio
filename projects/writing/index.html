    <blockquote>
  <p>It seems to me the first principle of the study of any belief system is that its ideas and terms must be stated in terms other than its own; that they must be projected on to some screen other than one which they themselves provide. They may and must speak, but they must not be judges in their own case. For concepts, like feelings and desires, have their cunning. Only in this way may we hope to lay bare the devices they employ to make their impact – whether or not those devices are, in the end, endorsed as legitimate.</p>

  <p>– <em>Ernest Gellner, The Psychoanalytic Movement: The Cunning of Unreason</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>How little we know <br />
About what we should believe <br />
On prior conditions</p>

  <p>If only we had a<br />
Way to determine what to<br />
Believe, we’d be free</p>

  <p>Behold, the method!<br />
As we gain more information<br />
Our inference gains</p>

  <p>Weighted certainty!<br />
At last the problem is solved<br />
And real fun begins</p>

  <p>– <em>Chesto</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> How do you select a problem to study?</p>

  <p><strong>Atiyah:</strong> I think that presupposes an answer. I don’t think that’s the way I work at all. Some people may sit back and say, “I want to solve this problem” and they sit down and say, “How do I solve this problem.’” I don’t. I just move around in the mathematical waters, thinking about things, being curious, interested, talking to people, stirring up ideas; things emerge and I follow them up. Or I see something which connects up with something else I know about, and I try to put them together and things develop. I have practically never started off with any idea of what I’m going to be doing or where it’s going to go. I’m interested in mathematics; I talk, I learn, I discuss and then interesting questions simply emerge. I have never started off with a particular goal, except the goal of understanding mathematics.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every intellectual has a very special responsibility. He has the privilege and the opportunity of studying. In return, he owes it to his fellow men (or ‘to society’) to represent the results of his study as simply, clearly and modestly as he can. The worst thing that intellectuals can do - the cardinal sin - is to try to set themselves up as great prophets vis-à-vis their fellow men and to impress them with puzzling philosophies. Anyone who cannot speak simply and clearly should say nothing and continue to work until he can do so.</p>

  <p>– <em>Karl Popper, <a href="http://www.the-rathouse.com/shortreviews/Against_Big_Words.pdf">Against Big Words</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to “order” than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: “I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action”…Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.</p>

  <p>– <em>MLK, <a href="https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html">Letter from a Birmingham Jail</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Modern writing at its worst does not consist in picking out words for the sake of their meaning and inventing images in order to make the meaning clearer. It consists in gumming together long strips of words which have already been set in order by someone else, and making the results presentable by sheer humbug.</p>

  <p>– <em>Orwell, <a href="http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit">Politics and the English Language</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>By ‘nationalism’ I mean first of all the habit of assuming that human beings can be classified like insects and that whole blocks of millions or tens of millions of people can be confidently labelled ‘good’ or ‘bad’(1). But secondly — and this is much more important — I mean the habit of identifying oneself with a single nation or other unit, placing it beyond good and evil and recognizing no other duty than that of advancing its interests.”</p>

  <p>– Orwell, <a href="http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/nationalism/english/e_nat">Notes on Nationalism</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Part of our emergency is that it’s so tempting to do this sort of thing now, to retreat to narrow arrogance, pre-formed positions, rigid filters, the ‘moral clarity’ of the immature. The alternative is dealing with massive, high- entropy amounts of info and ambiguity and conflict and flux; it’s continually discovering new areas of personal ignorance and delusion. In sum, to really try to be informed and literate today is to feel stupid nearly all the time, and to need help.”</p>

  <p>– <em>Wallace, <a href="http://neugierig.org/content/dfw/bestamerican.pdf">Deciderization 2007 — a Special Report</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was granted me to carry away from my prison years on my bent back, which nearly broke beneath its load, this essential experience; how a human being becomes evil and how good. In the intoxication of youthful successes I had felt myself to be infallible, and I was therefore cruel. In the surfeit of power I was a murderer, and an oppressor. In my most evil moments I was convinced that I was doing good, and I was well supplied with systematic arguments. And it was only when I lay there on rotting prison straw that I sensed within myself the first stirrings of good. Gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either—but right through every human heart—and through all human hearts. This line shifts. Inside us, it oscillates with the years. And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is retained. And even in the best of all hearts, there remains… an unuprooted small corner of evil.”.</p>

  <p>– <em>Solzhenitsyn</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After all, this was one of the main streams of camp corruption: the enlistment of prisoners in the trusty guards! You — had fallen. You — were punished. You — had been uprooted from life — but you want to avoid the very bottom of the pile? You want to hover over someone else, rifle in hand? Over your brother? Here! Take it! And if he runs — shoot him! We will even call you comrade. And we will give you a Red Army man’s ration. And … he grows proud. And … he tightens his grip on his gun stock. And . . , he shoots. And … he is even more severe than the free guards. (How is one to understand this: Was it really a purblind faith in social initiative? Or was it just an icy, contemptuous calculation based on the lowest human feelings?)</p>

  <p>– <em>Solzhenitsyn</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is not the task of our book, but let us try to enumerate briefly those traits of <em>free</em> life which were determined by the closeness of the Archipelago or which were in the same style.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><em>Constant Fear.</em> As the reader has already seen, the roster of the waves of recruitment into the Archipelago is not exhausted with 1935, or 1937, or 1949. The recruitment went on all the time. Just as there is no minute when people are not dying or being born, so there was no minute when people were not being arrested. Sometimes this came close to a person, sometimes it was further off; sometimes a person deceived himself into think- ing, that nothing threatened him, and sometimes he himself became an executioner, and thus the threat to him diminished. But any adult inhabitant of this country, from a collective farmer up to a member of the Politburo, always knew that it would take only one careless word or gesture and he would fly off irrevocably into the abyss. (…)</li>
    <li><em>Servitude.</em> If it had been easy to change your place of residence, to leave a place that had become dangerous for you and thus shake off fear and refresh yourself, people would have behaved more boldly, and they might have taken some risks. But for long decades we were shackled by that same system under which no worker could quit work of his own accord. And the passport regulations also fastened everyone to particular places. And the housing, which could not be sold, nor exchanged, nor rented. And because of this it was an insane piece of daring to protest in the place where you lived or worked. (…)</li>
    <li><em>Secrecy and Mistrust.</em> These feelings replaced our former openhearted cordiality and hospitality (which had still not been destroyed in the twenties). These feelings were the natural defense of any family and every person, particularly because no one could ever quit work or leave, and every little detail was kept in sight and within earshot for years. The secretiveness of the Soviet person is by no means superfluous, but is absolutely necessary, even though to a foreigner it may at times seem superhuman. The former Tsarist officer K.U. survived and was never arrested only because when he got married he did not tell his wife about his past. His brother, N.U., was arrested—and the wife of the arrested man, taking advantage of the fact that they lived in different cities at the time of his arrest, hid his arrest from her own father and mother—so they would not blurt it out. She preferred telling them and everyone else that her husband had abandoned her, and then playing that role a long time! Now these were the secrets of one family which I was told thirty years later. And what urban family did not have such secrets? (…)</li>
    <li><em>Universal Ignorance.</em> Hiding things from each other and not trusting each other, we ourselves helped implement that absolute secrecy, absolute misinformation, among us which was the cause of causes of everything that took place - including both the millions of arrests and the mass approval of them also. Informing one another of nothing, neither shouting nor groaning and learning nothing from one another, we were completely in the hands of the newspapers and the official orators. Every day they pushed in our faces some new piece of incitement, like a photograph of a railroad wreck (sabotage) somewhere three thousand miles away. And what we really needed to learn about, which was what had happened on our apartment landing that day, we had no way of finding out. (…) How could you become a citizen, knowing nothing about life around you? Only when you yourself were caught in the trap would you find out—too late.</li>
    <li><em>Squealing</em> was developed to a mind-boggling extent. Hundreds of thousands of Security officers in their official offices, in the innocent rooms of official buildings, and in prearranged apartments, sparing neither paper nor their unoccupied time, tirelessly recruited and summoned stool pigeons to give reports, and this in such enormous numbers as they could never have found necessary for collecting information. (…) I will give my own superficial speculative estimate: Out of every four to five city dwellers there would most certainly be one who at least once in his life had received a &gt;proposal to become an informer. (…) Beyond the purpose of weakening ties between people, there was another purpose as well. Any person who had let himself be recruited would, out of fear of public exposure, be very much interested in the continuing stability of the regime. (…) Secretiveness spread its cold tentacles throughout the whole people. It crept between colleagues at work, between old friends, students, soldiers, neighbors, children growing &gt;up—and even into the reception room of the NKVD, among the prisoners’ wives bringing food parcels.</li>
    <li><em>Betrayal as a Form of Existence.</em> Given this constant fear over a period of many years—^for oneself and one’s family—-a human being became a vassal of fear, subjected to it. And it turned out that the least dangerous form of existence was constant betrayal.  The mildest and at the same time most widespread form of betrayal was not to do anything bad directly, but just not to notice the doomed person next to one, not to help him, to turn away one’s face, to shrink back. They had arrested a neighbor, your comrade at work, or even your close friend. You kept silence. You acted as if you had not noticed. (For you could not afford to lose your current job!) And then it was announced at work, at the general meeting, that the person who had disappeared the day before was … an inveterate enemy of the people. And you, who had bent your back beside him for twenty years at the same desk, now by your noble silence (or even by your condemning speech!), had to show how hostile you were to his crimes. (You had to make this sacrifice for the sake of your own dear family, for your own dear ones! What right had you not to think about them?) But the person arrested had left behind him wife, a mother, children, and perhaps they at least ought to be helped? No, no, that would be dangerous: after all, these were the wife of an enemy and the mother of an enemy, and they were the children of an enemy (and your own children had a long education ahead of them)!… And one who concealed an enemy was also an enemy! And one who abetted an enemy was also an enemy! And one who continued his friendship with an enemy was also an enemy.  … And that was precisely what Stalin needed! And he laughed in his mustaches, the shoeshine boy! (…)</li>
    <li><em>Corruption.</em> In a situation of fear and betrayal over many years people survive unharmed only in a superficial, bodily sense. And inside…they become corrupt.(…) &gt; The aspects of corruption are varied, and it is not for us to cover them all in this chapter. The overall life of society came down to the fact that traitors were advanced and mediocrities triumphed, while everything that was best and most honest was trampled underfoot. Who can show me one case in the whole country from the thirties to the fifties of a noble person casting down, destroying, driving out a base troublemaker? I affirm that such a case would have been impossible, just as it is impossible for any waterfall to fall upward as an exception. After all, no noble person would turn to State Security, but for any villain it was always right there at hand. And State Security would not stop at anything, once it didn’t stop at what it did to Nikolai Vavilov. So why should the waterfall fall upward? (…)</li>
    <li><em>The Lie as a Form of Existence.</em> Whether giving in to fear, or influenced by material self-interest or envy, people can’t nonetheless become stupid so swiftly. Their souls may be thoroughly muddied, but they still have a sufficiently clear mind. They cannot believe that all the genius of the world has suddenly concentrated itself in one head with a flattened, low-hanging forehead. They simply cannot believe the stupid and silly images of themselves which they hear over the radio, see in films, and read in the newspapers. Nothing forces them to speak the truth in reply, but no one allows them to keep silent! They have to talk! And what else but a lie? They have to applaud madly, and no one requires honesty of them. (…) The permanent lie becomes the only safe form of existence, in the same way as betrayal. Every wag of the tongue can be overheard by someone, every facial expression observed by someone. Therefore every word, if it does not have to be a direct lie, is nonetheless obliged not to contradict the general, common lie. There exists a collection of ready-made phrases, of labels, a selection of ready-made lies. And not one single speech nor one single essay or article nor one single book—be it scientific, journalistic, -critical, or “literary,” so-called—can exist without the use of these primary cliches. (…)  But that was not all: Your children were growing up! If they weren’t yet old enough, you and your wife had to avoid saying openly in front of them what you really thought; after all, they were being brought up to be Pavlik Morozovs, to betray their own parents, and they wouldn’t hesitate to repeat his achievement. And if the children were still little, then you had to decide what was the best way to bring them up; whether to start them off on lies instead of the truth (so that it would be easier for them to live) and then to lie forevermore in front of them tool or to tell them the truth, with the risk that they might make a slip, that they might let it out, which meant that you had to instill into them from the start that the truth was murderous, that beyond the threshold of the house you had to lie, only he, just like papa and mama. The choice was really such that you would rather not have any children. (…)</li>
    <li><em>Cruelty</em> And where among all the preceding qualities was there any place left for kindheartedness? How could one possibly preserve one’s kindness while pushing away the hands of those who were drowning? Once you have been steeped in blood, you can only become more cruel. And, anyway, cruelty (“class cruelty”) was praised and instilled, and you would soon lose track, probably, of just where between bad and good that trait lay. And when you add that kindness was ridiculed, that pity was ridiculed, that mercy was ridiculed—you’d never be able to chain all those who were drunk on blood! (…)</li>
    <li><em>Slave Psychology.</em> That same unfortunate Babich in his declaration to the prosecutor: “I understand that wartime placed more serious obligations and duties on the organs of government than to sort out the charges against individual persons.”  And much else.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>But let us admit: if under Stalin this whole scheme of things did not just come into being on its own—and if, instead, he himself worked it all out for us point by point— he really was a genius!</p>

  <p>You don’t have to like baseball, but you should understand the concept of what a pitcher’s ERA means.  Approach life similarly.</p>

  <p>Do not pad ignorance with eloquence.</p>

  <p>The whole earth is the sepulchre of famous men; they are honoured not only by columns and inscriptions in their own land, but in foreign nations on memorials graven not on stone but in the hearts and minds of men.</p>

  <p>Good manners are the art of making those people easy with whom we converse.</p>

  <p>I am fifty years old and I have always lived in freedom; let me end my life free; when I am dead let this be said of me: ‘He belonged to no school, to no church, to no institution, to no academy, least of all to any regime except the regime of liberty.”</p>

  <p>A pair of wings, a different respiratory system, which enabled us to travel through space, would in no way help us, for if we visited Mars or Venus while keeping the same senses, they would clothe everything we could see in the same aspect as the things of the Earth. The only true voyage, the only bath in the Fountain of Youth, would be not to visit strange lands but to possess other eyes, to see the universe through the eyes of another, of a hundred others, to see the hundred universes that each of them sees, that each of them is</p>

  <p>Hope for the best. Expect the worst. Life is a play. We’re unrehearsed.</p>

  <p>And now the rule of your life is this: Do not rejoice when you have found, do not weep when you have lost.</p>
